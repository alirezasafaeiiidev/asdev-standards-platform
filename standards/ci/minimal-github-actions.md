# Minimal GitHub Actions Baseline

- Status: Active
- Version: 1.0.0
- Source ADRs: ADR-0001, ADR-0002

## Baseline Intent

Every consumer repository should have at least one CI workflow that runs on PRs and pushes to main/default branch.

## Minimum Jobs

- Lint placeholder
- Test placeholder

These placeholders must be replaced with language-aware checks in Level 1 standards.
